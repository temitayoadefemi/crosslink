# CrossLink

## Overview
CrossLink is a versatile library designed to manage and manipulate linked lists in both C and Python. This library provides a robust interface for performing various operations on linked lists such as insertion, deletion, searching, editing, reversing, and splitting the list.

## Features
### Python Implementation
- **Insert**: Add a new node to the end of the list.
- **Delete**: Remove a node by its key.
- **Search**: Find a node by its key.
- **Replace**: Replace an existing node with a new node.
- **Edit**: Modify the value of a node.
- **Reverse**: Reverse the order of nodes in the list.
- **Split**: Divide the list into two sublists at a specified index.
- **Middle**: Gets the middle of a list
- **Sort**: Sorts the list

### C Implementation
- **Insert**: Append a node at the end of the list.
- **Delete**: Remove a node based on its key.
- **Search**: Locate a node using its key.
- **Replace**: Substitute a node with another.
- **Edit**: Update the value of a node.
- **Reverse**: Invert the list order.
- **Split**: Break the list into two parts based on an index.
- **Middle**: Gets the middle of a list
- **Sort**: Sorts the list
